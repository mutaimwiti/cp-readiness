**Hello**

My name is `Mutai Mwiti`, a passionate software developer.
I'm a person that has loved technology from a young age and 
this makes me to have interests that go beyond just coding.
I have a deep love automobiles and their internals. That 
goes without saying that I also love driving and perfecting 
my driving skills. My favourite automobile brand is 
Lamborghini and the model I admire the most is the [Hurac√°n 
Performante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ULSUcERlQQ).
I must also mention my love for Nissan GTR, the car whose 
on-board computer is believed by many to perform a lot 
wizardly to defy many laws of physics. I also love 
electronics and this has taken me as far as learning a 
little bit of micro-controller programming with Arduino.
